This Board is an Arduino Compatable IMU/MARGS solution.
Given the Correct Firmware this unit can calculate its orientation 
relative to the earth at any given time.

IMU = Inertial Measurement Unit
MARGS = Magnetic, Angular Rate, Gravity Sensor


Main Parts include:

ITG3200 	    3 axis gyroscope
ADXL345 	    3 axis accelerometer
HMC5883L 	    3 axis magnetometer
ATMEGA328P 	    Microcontroller
ATMEGA8U2 	    USB Microcontroller
PCA9306DCUR 	i2c logic level translator

!!!!!!!!NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!
	-I recently recieved the pcb and assembled my first unit.  It works perfectly.
	 However, the Resonator that I ordered (in the parts list) is too big to fit on the footprint.
	 Instead use a CSTCE16 from Murata.
	 
	 The 3x4 Interupt/ IO select header will not work with standard male headers because the holes are too small.
	 Workaround by using swiss machine pin headers, or headers with a small diameter pin.
