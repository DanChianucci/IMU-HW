The Goal of this project is to create a 9 dof MARGS/AHRS/IMU circuit board.  

Main Parts include:

ITG3200 	3 axis gyroscope
ADXL345 	3 axis accelerometer
HMC5883L 	3 axis magnetometer
ATMEGA328P 	microcontroller
ATMEGA8U2 	microcontroller
PCA9306DCUR 	i2c logic level translator

 
These Schematics and Board Layout Files were created using EagleCad Which can be found at:
